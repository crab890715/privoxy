    user.action. (Closes: #385886).

  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.7.2 (no changes).
  * 17_502_no_such_domain.dpatch: Changes the 404 HTTP status code of the
    "No such Domain" template to 502 Bad Gateway, which seems to be more
    correct according to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
    (Closes: #380389).
  * Disable filter{js-annoyances} and filter{unsolicited-popups} for

    - Convert Latin-1 char รก to groff eqivalent in man page.
    - Quote minus signs to differenciate them from hyphens.
