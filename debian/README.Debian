privoxy for Debian
==================

- enable-edit-actions and enable-remote-toggle are disabled in the
  Debian package for security reasons, because these options allow
  every user of your privoxy to change its configuration. If you still
  want to use these features, you can enable them in
  /etc/privoxy/config and do a "/etc/init.d/privoxy restart".

- A patch was applied to access the local copy of the user manual
  (/usr/share/doc/privoxy/user-manual/*) was applied.  With the option
   user-manual /usr/share/doc/privoxy/user-manual
  in /etc/privoxy/config this is activated and the manual can be
  accessed as http://config.privoxy.org/user-manual
