privoxy for Debian
==================

- enable-edit-actions and enable-remote-toggle are disabled in the
  Debian package for security reasons, because these options allow
  every user of your privoxy to change its configuration. If you still
  want to use these features, you can enable them in
  /etc/privoxy/config and do a "/etc/init.d/privoxy restart".

- Experimental IPv6 support was added to the package.

- The global default for all URLs (/) is no longer set in
  default.action but in a new file global.action, so your local
  changes should go to global.action and user.action only, while
  default.action is maintained by package upgrades automatically.

- Since 3.0.5 the upstream package uses the Cautious default settings
  instead of Medium (like 3.0.3 did).  To avoid problems on upgrades
  of old packages, the Debian package still uses the Medium settings.
  You can find the different profiles in /etc/privoxy/standard.action.
  To change the default, go to http://p.p/edit-actions-list?f=global
  (this can also be reached from http://p.p/show-status via the
  global.action edit link) and modify the default to your needs.  You
  can either set one of the standard profiles (Cautious, Medium, or
  Advanced) or change every single setting using the "Edit" button.
  It is necessary to set "enable-edit-actions 1" (see above) in
  /etc/privoxy/config to use the web interface.  Alternatively you can
  modify /etc/privoxy/global.action by hand.  The other templates are
  available in /etc/privoxy/standard.action.

- /etc/privoxy/default.action is now owned by root, so you can not
  modify it via http://p.p/edit-actions-list?f=default any longer
  (assumed that you set "enable-edit-action 1" above).  You should
  realize your local adaptions in /etc/privoxy/global.action and
  /etc/privoxy/user.action, so default.action can be easily upgraded
  by new package versions.  If you do not like this change, feel free
  to change the owner of default.action to "privoxy" and the file is
  editable again.
