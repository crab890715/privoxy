privoxy for Debian
==================

- enable-edit-actions, enable-remote-toggle, and
  enable-remote-http-toggle are disabled in the Debian package for
  security reasons, because these options allow every user of your
  privoxy to change its configuration.  Except this there exist
  exploits using Java and/or JavaScript that tell your browser to send
  out requests for disabling the proxy or the filtering, which may
  compromise your anonymity.  If you still want to use these features,
  you can enable them in /etc/privoxy/config and do a
  "/etc/init.d/privoxy restart".

- Comment "debug 1" from default configuration, so GET/POST/CONNECT
  requests are no longer logged by default to protect your privacy a
  bit more.

- Experimental IPv6 support patch is available in the source package
  but currently disabled because of too many side effects and bugs.
  If you really need it, you can try to compile the Debian package
  sources yourself and enable it in debian/patches/00list.

- The global default for all URLs (/) is no longer set in
  default.action but in a new file global.action, so your local
  changes should go to global.action and user.action only, while
  default.action is maintained by package upgrades automatically.

- Since 3.0.5 the upstream package uses the Cautious default settings
  instead of Medium (like 3.0.3 did).  To avoid problems on upgrades
  of old packages, the Debian package still uses the Medium settings.
  You can find the different profiles in /etc/privoxy/standard.action.
  To change the default, go to http://p.p/edit-actions-list?f=global
  (this can also be reached from http://p.p/show-status via the
  global.action edit link.  p.p is a privoxy internal address, so you
  need to use privoxy as your HTTP proxy before you can access these
  URLs) and modify the default to your needs.  You can either set one
  of the standard profiles (Cautious, Medium, or Advanced) or change
  every single setting using the "Edit" button.  It is necessary to
  set "enable-edit-actions 1" (see above) in /etc/privoxy/config to
  use the web interface.  Alternatively you can modify
  /etc/privoxy/global.action by hand.  The other templates are
  available in /etc/privoxy/standard.action.

- /etc/privoxy/default.action is now owned by root, so you can not
  modify it via http://p.p/edit-actions-list?f=default any longer
  (assumed that you set "enable-edit-action 1" above).  You should
  realize your local adaptions in /etc/privoxy/global.action and
  /etc/privoxy/user.action, so default.action can be easily upgraded
  by new package versions.  If you do not like this change, feel free
  to change the owner of default.action to "privoxy" and the file is
  editable again.
