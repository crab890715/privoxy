privoxy for Debian
==================

- enable-edit-actions and enable-remote-toggle are disabled in the
  Debian package for security reasons, because these options allow
  every user of your privoxy to change its configuration. If you still
  want to use these features, you can enable them in
  /etc/privoxy/config and do a "/etc/init.d/privoxy restart".
