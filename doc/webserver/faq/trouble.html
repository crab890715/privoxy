CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 browser is configured for a different port than what
 <SPAN

><P
> The old <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Junkbuster</SPAN
>) used port 8000 by 
 default. This has been changed to port 8118 now, due to a conflict 
 with NAS (Network Audio Service), which uses port 8000. If you haven't, 
 you need to change your browser to the new port number, or alternately 
 change the <A

>5.2. I just added a new rule, but the steenkin ad is 
still getting through. How?</H3
><P
> If the ad had been displayed before you added its URL, it will probably be
 held in the browser's cache for some time, so it will be displayed without
 the need for any request to the server, and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 will not be in the picture. The best thing to do is try flushing the browser's
 caches. And then try again.</P
><P
> If this doesn't help, you probably have an error in the rule you
 applied. Try pasting the full URL of the offending ad into <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</A
>
 and see if it really matches your new rule.</P

>5.3. One of my favorite sites does not work with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>.
What can I do?</H3
><P
> First verify that it is indeed a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> problem, 
 by toggling off <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> through <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/toggle"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/toggle</A
>,
 and then shift-reloading the problem page (i.e. holding down the shift key
 while clicking reload. Alternatively, flush your browser's disk and memory
 caches).</P
><P
> If still a problem, go to <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</A
>
 and paste the full URL of the page in question into the prompt. See which actions
 are being applied to the URL, and which matches in which actions files are
 responsible for that. Now, armed with this information, go to <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</A
>
 and select the appropriate actions files for editing.</P
><P
> You can now either look for a section which disables the actions that
 you suspect to cause the problem and add a pattern for your site there,
 or make up a completely new section for your site. In any case, the recommended
 way is to disable only the prime suspect, reload the problem page, and only
 if the problem persists, disable more and more actions until you have
 identified the culprit. You may or may not want to turn the other actions
 on again. Remember to flush your browser's caches in between any such changes!</P
><P
> Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can accomplish 
 the same thing by editing the appropriate actions file. Probably the easiest 
 way to deal with such problems when editing by hand is to add your
 site to a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{ fragile }</TT
> section in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
>,
 which is an alias that turns off most <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dangerous"</SPAN
>
 actions, but is also likely to turn off more actions then needed, and thus lower
 your privacy and protection more than necessary, </P
><P
> Troubleshooting actions is discussed in more detail in the <A

>5.4. After installing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, I have to log in
every time I start IE. What gives?</H3
><P
> This is a quirk that effects the installation of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, in conjunction with Internet Explorer and
 Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The symptoms may
 appear to be corrupted or invalid DUN settings, or passwords.</P
><P
> When setting up an NT based Windows system with
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> you may find that things do not seem to be
 doing what you expect. When you set your system up you will probably have set
 up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) with Dial up Networking (DUN) when
 logged in with administrator privileges. You will probably have made this DUN
 connection available to other accounts that you may have set-up on your
 system. E.g. Mum or Dad sets up the system and makes accounts suitably
 configured for the kids.</P
><P
> When setting up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> in this environment you
 will have to alter the proxy set-up of Internet Explorer (IE) for the
 specific DUN connection on which you wish to use
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. When you do this the ICS DUN set-up
 becomes user specific. In this instance you will see no difference if you
 change the DUN connection under the account used to set-up the connection.
 However when you do this from another user you will notice that the DUN
 connection changes to make available to "Me only". You will also find that
 you have to store the password under each different user!</P
><P
> The reason for this is that each user's set-up for IE is user specific. Each
 set-up DUN connection and each LAN connection in IE store the settings for
 each user individually. As such this enforces individual configurations
 rather than common ones. Hence the first time you use a DUN connection after
 re-booting your system it may not perform as you expect, and prompt you for 
 the password. Just set and save the password again and all should be OK.</P

>5.5. I cannot connect to any FTP sites. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 seems to be blocking me.</H3
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> cannot act as a proxy for FTP traffic, 
  so do not configure your browser to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  as an FTP proxy. The same is true for any protocol other than HTTP or HTTPS.
 </P
><P
>  Most browsers understand FTP as well as HTTP. If you connect to a site, with
  a URL like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.example.com</TT
>, your browser is making
  an FTP connection, and not a HTTP connection. So while your browser may 
  speak FTP, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> does not, and cannot proxy 
  such traffic.

>5.6. In Mac OSX, I can't configure Microsoft Internet Explorer to use 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> as the HTTP proxy.</H3
><P
>  Microsoft Internet Explorer (in versions like 5.1) respects system-wide
  network settings.  In order to change the HTTP proxy, open System
  Preferences, and click on the Network icon.  In the settings pane that
  comes up, click on the Proxies tab.  Ensure the "Web Proxy (HTTP)" checkbox 
  is checked and enter <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127.0.0.1</TT
> in the entry field.  
  Enter <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>8118</TT

  IE, it should reflect these values.

><P
>  Just dragging the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  not enough to delete it.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  <SPAN

  these details.  Open the trash, drag the <SPAN

  file out of the trash and double-click on it.  You will be prompted for
  confirmation and the administration password.

><P
>  More than likely this is a problem with the network stack. ZoneAlarm has
  been reported to cause this symptom -- even if not running. The solution is
  to either fight the ZA configuration, or uninstall ZoneAlarm, and then find
  something better behaved in its place. Other firewall type products may
  cause similar type problems if not configured correctly.
