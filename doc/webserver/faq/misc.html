has to add extra time to browsing.</H3
><P
> How much of an impact depends on many things, including the CPU of the host
 system, how aggressive the configuration is, which specific actions are being triggered, 
 the size of the page, etc.</P
><P
> Overall, it should not slow you down any in real terms, and may actually help 
 speed things up since ads, banners and other junk are not typically being
 retrieved and displayed. The actual processing time required by
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> itself for each page, is relatively small
 in the overall scheme of things, and happens very quickly. This is typically
 more than offset by time saved not downloading and rendering ad images (if ad
 blocking is being used).</P

CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS"
TARGET="_top"
>deanimate-gifs</A
></TT
>
 actions will certainly cause a perceived slowdown, since the entire document
 needs to be buffered before displaying. And on very large documents, there may be
 some impact. How much depends on the page size, the actual definition of the
 filter(s), etc. See below. Most other actions have little to no impact on
 speed.</P

>
 action, the entire document must be loaded into memory in order for the filtering 
 mechanism to work, and nothing is sent to the browser during this time.</P
><P
> The loading time typically does not really change much in real numbers, but
 the feeling is different, because most browsers are able to start rendering
 incomplete content, giving the user a feeling of "it works". This effect is
 more noticeable on slower dialup connections. Extremely large documents
 may have some impact on the time to load the page where there is filtering
 being done. But overall, the difference should be very minimal. If there is a
 big impact, then probably some other problem is contributing.
 </P
><P

 that if the web server mis-reports the MIME type, then content that should
 not be filtered, could be. <SPAN

 to differentiate filterable content because of the MIME type as reported by
 the server, or because of some configuration setting that enables/disables

><P
> If you run both the browser and the proxy locally, you cannot hide your IP
 address with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> or ultimately any other
 software. The server needs to know your IP address so that it knows where to
 send the responses back. </P
><P
> There are many publicly usable "anonymous" proxies out there, which
 provide a further level of indirection between you and the web server.</P
><P
> However, these proxies are called "anonymous" because you don't need
 a password, not because they would offer any real anonymity.
 Most of them will log your IP address and make it available to the
 authorities in case you violate the law of the country they run in. In fact
 you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
 on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.</P
><P
> Your best bet is to chain <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 with <A
HREF="http://tor.eff.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Tor</A
>,
 an  <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/"

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

>
 or a similar system and know what you're doing when it comes to configuring
 the rest of your system, it would be safest to assume that everything you do
 on the Web can be traced back to you.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can remove various information about you,
 and allows <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>you</I
></SPAN
> more freedom  to decide which sites 
 you can trust, and what details you want to reveal. But it neither 
 hides your ip address, nor can it guarantee that the rest of the system
 behaves correctly. There are several possibilities how a web sites can find
 out who you are, even if you are using a strict <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 configuration and chained it with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tor</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Most of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> protection can be easily subverted
 by an insecure browser configuration, therefore you should use a browser that can
 be configured to only execute code from trusted sites, and be careful which sites you trust.
 For example there is no point in having <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 modify the User-Agent header, if websites can get all the information they want
 through JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, Java etc.</P
><P
> A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>NSClean</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,

>4.10. Might some things break because header information or
content is being altered?</H3
><P
> Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what to
 display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be handled, 
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User-Agent"</SPAN
> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now (at least not
 further than removing the OS information) is not recommended, since so many
 sites do look for it. You may get undesirable results by changing this.</P
><P
> For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User Agent"</SPAN
> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Referer"</SPAN
> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Referer"</SPAN
> or cookie is provided, is another example. (But you
 can forge both headers without giving information away). There are
 many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server.</P
><P
> Similar thoughts apply to modifying JavaScript, and, to a lesser degree,
 HTML elements.</P

 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.</P

ads used to be. Why?</H3
><P
> It would be technically possible eliminate the banners in a way that frees
 their screen estate in many cases, by doing all banner blocking with filters,
 i.e. eliminating the whole image references from the HTML pages instead
 of letting them stay in, and blocking the resulting requests for the
 banners themselves.</P
><P
> But this would consume considerable CPU resources, would likely destroy
 the layout of many web pages which rely on the banners consuming a certain
 amount of screen space, and would fail in other cases, where the screen space
 is reserved e.g. by tables anyway. Also, making the banners disappear without
 a visual trace complicates troubleshooting.</P

 there is little that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 gibberish data though from one end to the other unprocessed.</P
><P
> The only exception to this is blocking by host patterns, as the client needs
 to tell <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> the name of the remote server,
 so that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can establish the connection.
 If that name matches a host-only pattern, the connection will be blocked.</P
><P
> As far as ad blocking is concerned, this is less of a restriction than it may
 seem, since ad sources are often identifiable by the host name, and often
 the banners to be placed in an encrypted page come unencrypted nonetheless
 for efficiency reasons, which exposes them to the full power of 
 <SPAN

> There are no known exploits that might affect
 <SPAN

 <SPAN

 <SPAN

 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main

><P

 viewing a document (i.e. a page), and downloading a file. The same is true of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK"

 it will still be blocked, and of course this is obvious. 
 </P
><P
> Filtering is potentially more of a concern since the results are not always
 so obvious, and the effects of filtering are there whether the file is simply
 viewed, or downloaded. And potentially whether the content is some obnoxious
 advertisement, or Mr. Jimmy's latest/greatest source code jewel. Of course,
 one of these presumably is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bad"</SPAN
> content that we don't want, and
 the other is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 distinguish <SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Document Type"</SPAN
> as reported by the webserver. If this is
 reported accurately (e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"application/zip"</SPAN
> for a zip archive),
 then <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> knows to ignore these where
 appropriate. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> potentially can filter HTML
 as well as plain text documents, subject to configuration parameters of
 course. Also, documents that are of an unknown type (generally assumed to be
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"text/plain"</SPAN
>) can be filtered, as will those that might be
 incorrectly reported by the webserver. If such a file is a downloaded file
 that is intended to be saved to disk, then any content that might have been
 altered by filtering, will be saved too, for these (probably rare) cases.</P
><P
> Note that versions later than 3.0.2 do NOT filter document types reported as 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"text/plain"</SPAN
>. Prior to this, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 did filter this document type.</P
><P
> In short, filtering is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ON"</SPAN
> if a) the Document Type as reported
 by the webserver is appropriate <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and</I
></SPAN

 allows it (or at least does not disallow it). That's it. There is no magic
 cookie anywhere to say this is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"good"</SPAN
> and this is
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bad"</SPAN
>. It's the configuration that let's it all happen or not.</P
><P
> If you download text files, you probably do not want these to be filtered,
 particularly if the content is source code, or other critical content. Source
 code sometimes might be mistaken for Javascript (i.e. the kind that might
 open a pop-up window). It is recommended to turn off filtering for download
 sites (particularly if the content may be plain text files and you are using
 version 3.0.2 or earlier) in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
> file. And
 also, for any site or page where making <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

 all to the content is to be avoided.</P
