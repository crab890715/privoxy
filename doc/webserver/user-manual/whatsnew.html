>Privoxy 3.0.13</SPAN
> introduces IPv6 support,
 improved keep-alive support and a bunch of minor improvements:</P

><P
>    Added IPv6 support. Thanks to Petr Pisar who not only provided
    the initial patch but also helped a lot with the integration.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Added client-side keep-alive support. This should also allow
    NTLM authentication through Privoxy, but this hasn't been
    confirmed yet.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    The connection sharing code is only used if the connection-sharing
    option is enabled.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    The max-client-connections option has been added to restrict
    the number of client connections below a value enforced by
    the operating system.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Fixed a regression reintroduced in 3.0.12 that could cause
    crashes on mingw32 if header date randomization was enabled.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Compressed content with extra fields couldn't be decompressed
    and would get passed to the client unfiltered. This problem
    has only be detected through statical analysis with clang as
    nobody seems to be using extra fields anyway.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    If the server resets the Connection after sending only the headers
    Privoxy forwards what it got to the client. Previously Privoxy
    would deliver an error message instead.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Error messages in case of connection timeouts use the right
    HTTP status code.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    If spawning a child to handle a request fails, the client
    gets an error message and Privoxy continues to listen for
    new requests right away.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    The error messages in case of server-connection timeouts or
    prematurely closed server connections are now template-based.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    If zlib support isn't compiled in, Privoxy no longer tries to
    filter compressed content unless explicitly asked to do so.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    In case of connections that are denied based on ACL directives,
    the memory used for the client IP is no longer leaked.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Fixed another small memory leak if the client request times out
    while waiting for client headers other than the request line.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    The client socket is kept open until the server socket has
    been marked as unused. This should increase the chances that
    the still-open connection will be reused for the client's next
    request to the same destination. Note that this only matters
    if connection-sharing is enabled.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    A TODO list has been added to the source tarballs to give potential
    volunteers a better idea of what the current goals are. Donations
    are still welcome too: http://www.privoxy.org/faq/general.html#DONATE

 versions of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

>:</P
><P
> <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>   The recommended way to upgrade <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is to backup your old 
   configuration files, install the new ones, verify that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
   is working correctly and finally merge back your changes using
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>diff</SPAN
> and maybe <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>patch</SPAN
>.
  </P
><P
>   There are a number of new features in each <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> release and
   most of them have to be explicitly enabled in the configuration
   files. Old configuration files obviously don't do that and due
   to syntax changes using old configuration files with a new
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> isn't always possible anyway.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  
    Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely,
    including configuration files, therefore you should really save
    any important configuration files!
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  
   On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing configuration 
   files, thinking you will want to do that yourself.

><P
>   In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now.
   You can change that in the <A
HREF="config.html#DEBUG"
>debug section</A
>
   of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
   logging until you verified that the new <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> version is working
   as expected.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Three other config file settings are now off by default: 
     <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE"
>enable-remote-toggle</A
>,
     <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE"
>enable-remote-http-toggle</A
>,
     and  <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS"
>enable-edit-actions</A
>. 
     If you use or want these, you will need to explicitly enable them, and
     be aware of the security issues involved.
