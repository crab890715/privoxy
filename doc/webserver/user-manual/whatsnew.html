><P
>   The recommended way to upgrade <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

   configuration files, install the new ones, verify that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
   is working correctly and finally merge back your changes using
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>diff</SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>patch</SPAN
>.
  </P
><P
>   There are a number of new features in each <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> release and
   most of them have to be explicitly enabled in the configuration
   files. Old configuration files obviously don't do that and due
   to syntax changes using old configuration files with a new
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> isn't always possible anyway.

    Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely,
    including configuration files, therefore you should really save
    any important configuration files!

   On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing configuration 
   files, thinking you will want to do that yourself.

   You can change that in the <A
HREF="config.html#DEBUG"
>debug section</A
>
   of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
   logging until you verified that the new <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> version is working
   as expected.
  </P

><P
>     Three other config file settings are now off by default: 
     <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE"
>enable-remote-toggle</A
>,
     <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE"
>enable-remote-http-toggle</A
>,
     and  <A
HREF="config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS"
>enable-edit-actions</A
>. 
     If you use or want these, you will need to explicitly enable them, and
     be aware of the security issues involved.
