><P
> All text substitutions that can be invoked through the
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#FILTER"
>filter</A

 must first be defined in the filter file, which is typically
 called <TT

>default.filter</TT
> and which can be
 selected through the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
> <A
HREF="config.html#FILTERFILE"

 option.</P
><P
> Typical reasons for doing such substitutions are to eliminate
 common annoyances in HTML and JavaScript, such as pop-up windows,
 exit consoles, crippled windows without navigation tools, the
 infamous &#60;BLINK&#62; tag etc, to suppress images with certain
 width and height attributes (standard banner sizes or web-bugs),
 or just to have fun. The possibilities are endless.</P
><P
> Filtering works on any text-based document type, including plain
 text, HTML, JavaScript, CSS etc. (all <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text/*</TT
>
 MIME types). Substitutions are made at the source level, so if
 you want to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"roll your own"</SPAN
> filters, you should be
 familiar with HTML syntax.</P
><P
> Just like the <A
HREF="actions-file.html"
>actions files</A
>, the
 filter file is organized in sections, which are called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filters</I
>
 here. Each filter consists of a heading line, that starts with the
 <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>keyword</I
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FILTER:</TT
>, followed by
 the filter's <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>name</I
>, and a short (one line) 
 <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>description</I
> of what it does. Below that line
 come the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>jobs</I
>, i.e. lines that define the actual
 text substitutions. By convention, the name of a filter
 should describe what the filter <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>eliminates</I
>. The
 comment is used in the <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>web-based
 user interface</A
>.</P
><P
> Once a filter called <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>name</I
></TT
> has been defined
 in the filter file, it can be invoked by using an action of the form
 +<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#FILTER"
>filter</A
>{<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>name</I
></TT
>}</TT
>
 in any <A
HREF="actions-file.html"
>actions file</A
>.</P
><P
> A filter header line for a filter called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 like this:</P

 in a syntax that imitates <A

 for the subtle differences to Perl behaviour. Most notably, the non-standard
 option letter <TT

 to ungreedy matching.</P

 a filter that protects against some common annoyances that arise from JavaScript

></TD

><P
> Following the header line and a comment, you see the job. Note that it uses
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>|</TT
> as the delimiter instead of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</TT
>, because
 the pattern contains a forward slash, which would otherwise have to be escaped
 by a backslash (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\</TT
>).</P
><P
> Now, let's examine the pattern: it starts with the text <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#60;script.*</TT
>
 enclosed in parentheses. Since the dot matches any character, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT
>
 means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Match an arbitrary number of the element left of myself"</SPAN
>, this
 matches <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
>, followed by <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any</I
> text, i.e.
 it matches the whole page, from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag.</P
><P
> That's more than we want, but the pattern continues: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>document\.referrer</TT
>
 matches only the exact string <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. The dot needed to
 be <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>escaped</I
>, i.e. preceded by a backslash, to take away its
 special meaning as a joker, and make it just a regular dot. So far, the meaning is:
 Match from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag in a the page, up to, and including,
 the text <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, if <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>both</I
> are present
 in the page (and appear in that order).</P
><P
> But there's still more pattern to go. The next element, again enclosed in parentheses,
 is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*&#60;/script&#62;</TT
>. You already know what <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
>
 means, so the whole pattern translates to: Match from the start of the first  &#60;script&#62;
 tag in a page to the end of the last &#60;script&#62; tag, provided that the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> appears somewhere in between.</P
><P
> This is still not the whole story, since we have ignored the options and the parentheses:
 The portions of the page matched by sub-patterns that are enclosed in parentheses, will be
 remembered and be available through the variables <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1, $2, ...</TT
> in
 the substitute. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</TT
> option switches to ungreedy matching, which means
 that the first <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
> in the pattern will only <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"eat up"</SPAN
> all
 text in between <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
> and the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
> occurrence
 of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, and that the second <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
> will
 only span the text up to the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;/script&#62;"</SPAN
>
 tag. Furthermore, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>s</TT
> option says that the match may span
 multiple lines in the page, and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>g</TT
> option again means that the
 substitution is global.</P
><P
> So, to summarize, the pattern means: Match all scripts that contain the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. Remember the parts of the script from
 (and including) the start tag up to (and excluding) the string
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
>, and the part following
 that string, up to and including the closing tag, as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</TT
>.</P
><P
> Now the pattern is deciphered, but wasn't this about substituting things? So
 lets look at the substitute: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1"Not Your Business!"$2</TT
> is
 easy to read: The text remembered as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
>, followed by 
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</TT
> (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>including</I
>
 the quotation marks!), followed by the text remembered as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</TT
>.
 This produces an exact copy of the original string, with the middle part
 (the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>) replaced by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your
 Business!"</TT
>.</P
><P
> The whole job now reads: Replace <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> by
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</TT
> wherever it appears inside a
 &#60;script&#62; tag. Note that this job won't break JavaScript syntax,
 since both the original and the replacement are syntactically valid
 string objects. The script just won't have access to the referrer
 information anymore.</P
><P
> We'll show you two other jobs from the JavaScript taming department, but
 this time only point out the constructs of special interest:</P

></TABLE
></P
><P
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\s</TT

 carriage return, form feed), so that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"zero
 or more whitespace"</SPAN
>. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>?</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*?</TT
>
 makes this matching of arbitrary text ungreedy. (Note that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</TT
>
 option is not set). The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>['"]</TT
> construct means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a single
 <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>or</I
> a double quote"</SPAN
>. Finally, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\1</TT
> is
 a backreference to the first parenthesis just like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
> above,
 with the difference that in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pattern</I
>, a backslash indicates
 a backreference, whereas in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>substitute</I
>, it's the dollar.</P
><P
> So what does this job do? It replaces assignments of single- or double-quoted
 strings to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window.status"</SPAN
> object with a dummy assignment
 (using a variable name that is hopefully odd enough not to conflict with
 real variables in scripts). Thus, it catches many cases where e.g. pointless
 descriptions are displayed in the status bar instead of the link target when
 you move your mouse over links.</P
