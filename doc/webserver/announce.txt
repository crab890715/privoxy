              Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.13 beta
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy 3.0.13 beta introduces IPv6 support, improved keep-alive
support and a bunch of minor improvements.

See http://www.privoxy.org/3.0.13/user-manual/whatsnew.html for details.

ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.13 beta  ***

- Added IPv6 support. Thanks to Petr Pisar who not only provided
  the initial patch but also helped a lot with the integration.
- Added client-side keep-alive support. This should also allow
  NTLM authentication through Privoxy, but this hasn't been
  confirmed yet.
- The connection sharing code is only used if the connection-sharing
  option is enabled.
- The max-client-connections option has been added to restrict
  the number of client connections below a value enforced by
  the operating system.
- Fixed a regression reintroduced in 3.0.12 that could cause
  crashes on mingw32 if header date randomization was enabled.
- Compressed content with extra fields couldn't be decompressed
  and would get passed to the client unfiltered. This problem
  has only be detected through statical analysis with clang as
  nobody seems to be using extra fields anyway.
- If the server resets the Connection after sending only the headers
  Privoxy forwards what it got to the client. Previously Privoxy
  would deliver an error message instead.
- Error messages in case of connection timeouts use the right
  HTTP status code.
- If spawning a child to handle a request fails, the client
  gets an error message and Privoxy continues to listen for
  new requests right away.
- The error messages in case of server-connection timeouts or
  prematurely closed server connections are now template-based.
- If zlib support isn't compiled in, Privoxy no longer tries to
  filter compressed content unless explicitly asked to do so.
- In case of connections that are denied based on ACL directives,
  the memory used for the client IP is no longer leaked.
- Fixed another small memory leak if the client request times out
  while waiting for client headers other than the request line.
- The client socket is kept open until the server socket has
  been marked as unused. This should increase the chances that
  the still-open connection will be reused for the client's next
  request to the same destination. Note that this only matters
  if connection-sharing is enabled.
- A TODO list has been added to the source tarballs to give potential
  volunteers a better idea of what the current goals are.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GPL2.

Privoxy is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:


    *  Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
       alive independently from the client.

    *  Supports IPv6.

    *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
       and server headers.

    *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
       configure browsers individually.

    *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
       client headers.

    *  Can be chained with other proxies.

    *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
       http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
       tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

    *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
       invisible "web-bugs", JavaScript and HTML annoyances, pop-up windows,
       etc.)

    *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
       settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
       files won't overwrite individual user settings.

    *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
       files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

    *  GIF de-animation.

    *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

    *  Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).

    *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
       "blocked" page).

    *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.

    *  Improved signal handling, and a true daemon mode (Unix).
    
    *  Every feature now controllable on a per-site or per-location basis,
       configuration more powerful and versatile over-all.
