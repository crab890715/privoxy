                 Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.12
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy 3.0.12-stable is primarily a bugfix release.

See http://www.privoxy.org/3.0.12/user-manual/whatsnew.html for details.

ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.12  ***

- The socket-timeout option now also works on platforms whose
  select() implementation modifies the timeout structure.
  Previously the timeout was triggered even if the connection
  didn't stall. Reported by cyberpatrol.
- The Connection: keep-alive code properly deals with files
  larger than 2GB. Previously the connection was closed too
  early.
- The content length for files above 2GB is logged correctly.
- The user-manual directive on the show-status page links to
  the documentation location specified with the directive,
  not to the Privoxy website.
- When running in daemon mode, Privoxy doesn't log anything
  to the console unless there are errors before the logfile
  has been opened.
- The show-status page prints warnings about invalid directives
  on the same line as the directives themselves.
- Fixed several justified (but harmless) compiler warnings,
  mostly on 64 bit platforms.
- The mingw32 version explicitly requests the default charset
  to prevent display problems with some fonts available on more
  recent Windows versions. Patch by Burberry.
- The mingw32 version uses the Privoxy icon in the alt-tab
  windows. Patch by Burberry.
- The timestamp and the thread id is omitted in the "Fatal error"
  message box on mingw32.
- Fixed two related mingw32-only buffer overflows. Triggering
  them required control over the configuration file, therefore
  this isn't seen as a security issue.
- In verbose mode, or if the new option --show-skipped-tests
  is used, Privoxy-Regression-Test logs skipped tests and the
  skip reason.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GPL2.

Privoxy is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:


    *  Can keep outgoing connections alive and reuse them later on.

    *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
       and server headers.

    *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
       configure browsers individually.

    *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
       client headers.

    *  Can be chained with other proxies.

    *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
       http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
       tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

    *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
       invisible "web-bugs", JavaScript and HTML annoyances, pop-up windows,
       etc.)

    *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
       settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
       files won't overwrite individual user settings.

    *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
       files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

    *  Improved cookie management features (e.g. session based cookies).

    *  GIF de-animation.

    *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

    *  Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).

    *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
       "blocked" page).

    *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.

    *  Improved signal handling, and a true daemon mode (Unix).
    
    *  Every feature now controllable on a per-site or per-location basis,
       configuration more powerful and versatile over-all.
