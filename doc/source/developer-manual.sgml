      If you intend to help us with programming, documentation or packaging

        Please refer to the chapters 6 and 7 in
        <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">SF's site
        documentation</ulink> for the technical access details for your
        operating system. For historical reasons, the CVS server is
        called <literal>cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net</literal>, the repository is
        called <literal>ijbswa</literal>, and the source tree module is called

    <sect2 id="cvscommit"><title>CVS Commit Guideline</title>
      <para>
        The source tree is the heart of every software project. Every effort must
        be made to ensure that it is readable, compilable and consistent at all
        times. We therefore ask anyone with CVS access to strictly adhere to the
        following guidelines:

            Never (read: <emphasis>never, ever</emphasis>) be tempted to commit
            that small change without testing it thoroughly first. When we're

            changes.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>

          <listitem><para>
            If your changes span multiple files, and the code won't recompile unless
            all changes are committed (e.g. when changing the signature of a function),
            then commit all files one after another, without long delays in between.
            If necessary, prepare the commit messages in advance.

<sect1 id="documentation"><title>Documentation Guidelines</title>
  <para>
    All formal documents are maintained in Docbook SGML and located in the
    <computeroutput>doc/source/*</computeroutput> directory. You will need
    <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">Docbook</ulink>, the Docbook 
    DTD's and the Docbook modular stylesheets (or comparable alternatives),
    and either <application>jade</application> or
    <application>openjade</application> (recommended) installed in order to
    build docs from source. Currently there is <ulink
    url="../user-manual/index.html"><citetitle>user-manual</citetitle></ulink>,
    <ulink url="../faq/index.html"><citetitle>FAQ</citetitle></ulink>, and, of
    course this, the <citetitle>developer-manual</citetitle> in this format.
    The <citetitle>README</citetitle>, <citetitle>AUTHORS</citetitle>
    <citetitle>privoxy.1</citetitle> (man page) files are also now maintained
    as Docbook SGML. The finished files are all in the top-level source
    directory are generated files! Also, <filename>index.html</filename>, the
    <application>Privoxy</application> home page, is maintained as SGML.
    <emphasis>DO NOT edit these directly</emphasis>. Edit the SGML source, or
    contact someone involved in the documentation (at present Stefan and
    Hal).
    </para> 
    <para>
     Other, less formal documents (e.g. <filename>LICENSE</filename>,
     <filename>INSTALL</filename>) are maintained as plain text files in the
     top-level source directory. At least for the time being.
    </para>
    <para>
     Packagers are encouraged to include this documentation. For those without
     the ability to build the docs locally, text versions of each are kept in
     CVS. HTML versions are also now being kept in CVS under 
     <filename>doc/webserver/*</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Formal documents are built with the Makefile targets of
     <computeroutput>make dok</computeroutput>, or alternately
     <computeroutput>make redhat-dok</computeroutput>. If you have problems,
     try both. The build process uses the document SGML sources in
     <computeroutput>doc/source/*/*</computeroutput> to update all text files in
     <computeroutput>doc/text/</computeroutput> and to update all HTML
     documents in <computeroutput>doc/webserver/</computeroutput>.

  <para>
   Finished docs should be occasionally submitted to CVS
   (<filename>doc/webserver/*/*.html</filename>) so that those without 
   the ability to build them locally, have access to them if needed.
   This is especially important just prior to a new release! Please
   do this <emphasis>after</emphasis> the <literal>$VERSION</literal> and
   other release specific data in <filename>configure.in</filename> has been
   updated (this is done just prior to a new release).

<sect2 id="sgml">
<title>Quickstart to Docbook and SGML</title>
<para>
 If you are not familiar with SGML, it is a markup language similar to HTML. 
 Actually, not a mark up language per se, but a language used to define 
 markup languages. In fact, HTML is an SGML application. Both will use
 <quote>tags</quote> to format text and other content. SGML tags can be much
 more varied, and flexible, but do much of the same kinds of things. The tags,
 or <quote>elements</quote>, are definable in SGML. There is no set
 <quote>standards</quote>. Since we are using
 <application>Docbook</application>, our tags are those that are defined by 
 <application>Docbook</application>. Much of how the finish document is
 rendered is determined by the <quote>stylesheets</quote>.
 The stylesheets determine how each tag gets translated to HTML, or other
 formats.
</para>

<para>
 Tags in Docbook SGML need to be always <quote>closed</quote>. If not, you
 will likely generate errors. Example: <literal>&lt;title&gt;My
 Title&lt;/title&gt;</literal>. They are also case-insensitive, but we
 strongly suggest using all lower case. This keeps compatibility with
 [Docbook] <application>XML</application>.
</para>

<para>
 Our documents use <quote>sections</quote> for the most part. Sections
 will be processed into HTML headers (e.g. <literal>h1</literal> for 
 <literal>sect1</literal>). The <application>Docbook</application> stylesheets
 will use these to also generate the Table of Contents for each doc. Our 
 TOC's are set to a depth of three. Meaning <literal>sect1</literal>, 
 <literal>sect2</literal>, and <literal>sect3</literal> will have TOC 
 entries, but <literal>sect4</literal> will not. Each section requires 
 a <literal>&lt;title&gt;</literal> element, and at least one 
 <literal>&lt;para&gt;</literal>. There is a limit of five section 
 levels in Docbook, but generally three should be sufficient for our 
 purposes.
</para>

<para>
 Some common elements that you likely will use: 
</para>

<para>
  <simplelist>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;</emphasis>, paragraph delimiter. Most 
      text needs to be within paragraph elements (there are some exceptions).
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;emphasis&gt;&lt;/emphasis&gt;</emphasis>, the stylesheets
      make this italics.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;filename&gt;&lt;/filename&gt;</emphasis>, files and directories.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;command&gt;&lt;/command&gt;</emphasis>, command examples.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;literallayout&gt;&lt;/literallayout&gt;</emphasis>, like 
      <literal>&lt;pre&gt;</literal>, more or less.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;</emphasis>, list with bullets.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;</emphasis>, member of the above.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;screen&gt;&lt;/screen&gt;</emphasis>, screen output, implies 
      <literal>&lt;literallayout&gt;</literal>.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;ulink url="example.com"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;</emphasis>, like 
      HTML <literal>&lt;a&gt;</literal> tag.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;quote&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;</emphasis>, for, doh, quoting text. 
    </member>

       Tags delimiting a <emphasis>block</emphasis> of text (even small

 &lt;para&gt;
  Some text goes here.
 &lt;/para&gt;
       </literallayout>
       Tags marking individual words, or few words, should be in-line:

       </literallayout>

 <sect2><title>Privoxy Custom Entities</title>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> documentation is using 
  a number of customized <quote>entities</quote> to facilitate 
  documentation maintenance. 
 </para>
 <para>
  We are using a set of <quote>boilerplate</quote> files with generic text,
  that is used by multiple docs. This way we can write something once, and use
  it repeatedly without having to re-write the same content over and over again.
  If editing such a file, keep in mind that it should be
  <emphasis>generic</emphasis>. That is the purpose; so it can be used in varying 
  contexts without additional modifications.
 </para>
 <para>
  We are also using what <application>Docbook</application> calls 
  <quote>internal entities</quote>. These are like variables in 
  programming. Well, sort of. For instance, we have the
  <literal>p-version</literal> entity that contains the current 
  <application>Privoxy</application> version string. You are strongly 
  encouraged to use these where possible. Some of these obviously 
  require re-setting with each release (done by the Makefile). A sampling of
  custom entities are listed below. See any of the main docs for examples.
 </para>

 <para>
  <itemizedlist>

    Re- <quote>boilerplate</quote> text entities are defined like:

   </para>
   <para>
     In this example, the contents of the file,
     <filename>supported.sgml</filename> is available for inclusion anywhere 
     in the doc. To make this happen, just reference the now defined 
     entity: <literal>&#38;supported;</literal> (starts with an ampersand 
     and ends with a semi-colon), and the contents will be dumped into 
     the finished doc at that point.

    <sect2 id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This set of standards is designed to make our lives easier.  It is
    developed with the simple goal of helping us keep the "new and improved
    <application>Privoxy</application>" consistent and reliable. Thus making
    maintenance easier and increasing chances of success of the
    project.</para>

    <para>And that of course comes back to us as individuals. If we can
    increase our development and product efficiencies then we can solve more
    of the request for changes/improvements and in general feel good about
    ourselves. ;-></para>

    <sect2 id="s2"><title>Using Comments</title>
 

    <sect3 id="s3"><title>Comment, Comment, Comment</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Comment as much as possible without commenting the obvious.
    For example do not comment "aVariable is equal to bVariable".
    Instead explain why aVariable should be equal to the bVariable.
    Just because a person can read code does not mean they will
    understand why or what is being done. A reader may spend a lot
    more time figuring out what is going on when a simple comment
    or explanation would have prevented the extra research. Please
    help your brother IJB'ers out!</para>

    <para>The comments will also help justify the intent of the code.
    If the comment describes something different than what the code
    is doing then maybe a programming error is occurring.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/* if page size greater than 1k ... */
if ( PageLength() > 1024 )
{
    ... "block" the page up ...
}

/* if page size is small, send it in blocks */
if ( PageLength() > 1024 )
{
    ... "block" the page up ...
}

This demonstrates 2 cases of "what not to do".  The first is a
"syntax comment".  The second is a comment that does not fit what
is actually being done.
</programlisting>
  </sect3>

    

    <sect3 id="s4"><title>Use blocks for comments</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Comments can help or they can clutter. They help when they
    are differentiated from the code they describe. One line
    comments do not offer effective separation between the comment
    and the code. Block identifiers do, by surrounding the code
    with a clear, definable pattern.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * This will stand out clearly in your code!
 *********************************************************************/
if ( thisVariable == thatVariable )
{
   DoSomethingVeryImportant();
}


/* unfortunately, this may not */
if ( thisVariable == thatVariable )
{
   DoSomethingVeryImportant();
}


if ( thisVariable == thatVariable ) /* this may not either */
{
   DoSomethingVeryImportant();
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exception:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you are trying to add a small logic comment and do not
    wish to "disrupt" the flow of the code, feel free to use a 1
    line comment which is NOT on the same line as the code.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s5"><title>Keep Comments on their own line</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It goes back to the question of readability. If the comment
    is on the same line as the code it will be harder to read than
    the comment that is on its own line.</para>

    <para>There are three exceptions to this rule, which should be
    violated freely and often: during the definition of variables,
    at the end of closing braces, when used to comment
    parameters.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * This will stand out clearly in your code,
 * But the second example won't.

    <sect3 id="s6"><title>Comment each logical step</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Logical steps should be commented to help others follow the
    intent of the written code and comments will make the code more
    readable.</para>

    <para>If you have 25 lines of code without a comment, you should
    probably go back into it to see where you forgot to put
    one.</para>

    <para>Most "for", "while", "do", etc... loops _probably_ need a
    comment. After all, these are usually major logic
    containers.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s7"><title>Comment All Functions Thoroughly</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>A reader of the code should be able to look at the comments
    just prior to the beginning of a function and discern the
    reason for its existence and the consequences of using it. The
    reader should not have to read through the code to determine if
    a given function is safe for a desired use. The proper
    information thoroughly presented at the introduction of a
    function not only saves time for subsequent maintenance or
    debugging, it more importantly aids in code reuse by allowing a
    user to determine the safety and applicability of any function
    for the problem at hand. As a result of such benefits, all
    functions should contain the information presented in the
    addendum section of this document.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s8"><title>Comment at the end of braces if the
    content is more than one screen length</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Each closing brace should be followed on the same line by a
    comment that describes the origination of the brace if the
    original brace is off of the screen, or otherwise far away from
    the closing brace. This will simplify the debugging,
    maintenance, and readability of the code.</para>

    <para>As a suggestion , use the following flags to make the
    comment and its brace more readable:</para>

    <para>use following a closing brace: } /* -END- if() or while ()
    or etc... */</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
if ( 1 == X )
{
   DoSomethingVeryImportant();
   ...some long list of commands...
} /* -END- if x is 1 */

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The brace needs to be on a line all by itself, not at the
    end of the statement. Curly braces should line up with the
    construct that they're associated with. This practice makes it
    easier to identify the opening and closing braces for a
    block.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
if ( this == that )
{
   ...

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>if ( this == that ) { ... }</para>

    <para>if ( this == that ) { ... }</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> In the special case that the if-statement is
    inside a loop, and it is trivial, i.e. it tests for a
    condition that is obvious from the purpose of the block,
    one-liners as above may optically preserve the loop structure
    and make it easier to read.</para>

    <sect3 id="s17"><title>ALL control statements should have a
    block</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Using braces to make a block will make your code more
    readable and less prone to error. All control statements should
    have a block defined.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> The first example in "Instead of" will execute
    in a manner other than that which the developer desired (per

</programlisting>
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s20"><title>Don't use white space around structure
    operators</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>- structure pointer operator ( "->" ) - member operator (
    "." ) - functions and parentheses</para>

    <para>It is a general coding practice to put pointers, references,
    and function parentheses next to names. With spaces, the

    <sect3 id="s28"><title>Minimize function calls when iterating by
    using variables</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It is easy to write the following code, and a clear argument
    can be made that the code is easy to understand:</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
for ( size_t cnt = 0; cnt &lt; blockListLength(); cnt ++ )
{
   ....
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Unfortunately, this makes a function call for
    each and every iteration. This increases the overhead in the
    program, because the compiler has to look up the function each
    time, call it, and return a value. Depending on what occurs in
    the blockListLength() call, it might even be creating and
    destroying structures with each iteration, even though in each
    case it is comparing "cnt" to the same value, over and over.
    Remember too - even a call to blockListLength() is a function
    call, with the same overhead.</para>

    <para>Instead of using a function call during the iterations,
    assign the value to a variable, and evaluate using the
    variable.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
size_t len = blockListLength();

for ( size_t cnt = 0; cnt &lt; len; cnt ++ )
{
   ....
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis> if the value of blockListLength() *may*

  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s29"><title>Pass and Return by Const Reference</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>This allows a developer to define a const pointer and call
    your function. If your function does not have the const
    keyword, we may not be able to use your function. Consider
    strcmp, if it were defined as: extern int strcmp( char *s1,
    char *s2 );</para>

    <para>I could then not use it to compare argv's in main: int main(
    int argc, const char *argv[] ) { strcmp( argv[0], "privoxy"

    <para>Both these pointers are *const*! If the c runtime library

  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s30"><title>Pass and Return by Value</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Most structures cannot fit onto a normal stack entry (i.e.
    they are not 4 bytes or less). Aka, a function declaration
    like: int load_aclfile( struct client_state csp )</para>

  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s31"><title>Names of include files</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Your include statements should contain the file name without
    a path. The path should be listed in the Makefile, using -I as
    processor directive to search the indicated paths. An exception
    to this would be for some proprietary software that utilizes a
    partial path to distinguish their header files from system or
    other header files.</para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;     /* This is not a local include */

    <sect3 id="s33"><title>Use `extern "C"` when appropriate</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If our headers are included from C++, they must declare our
    functions as `extern "C"`. This has no cost in C, but increases
    the potential re-usability of our code.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif /* def __cplusplus */

... function definitions here ...

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif /* def __cplusplus */
</programlisting>
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s34"><title>Where Possible, Use Forward Struct
    Declaration Instead of Includes</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Useful in headers that include pointers to other struct's.
    Modifications to excess header files may cause needless
    compiles.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * We're avoiding an include statement here!
 *********************************************************************/
struct file_list;
extern file_list *xyz;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you declare "file_list xyz;" (without the
    pointer), then including the proper header file is necessary.
    If you only want to prototype a pointer, however, the header
    file is unnecessary.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> Use with discretion.</para>

    <sect2 id="s35"><title>General Coding Practices</title>

    

    <sect3 id="s36"><title>Turn on warnings</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation</emphasis></para>

    <para>Compiler warnings are meant to help you find bugs. You
    should turn on as many as possible. With GCC, the switch is
    "-Wall". Try and fix as many warnings as possible.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s37"><title>Provide a default case for all switch
    statements</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>What you think is guaranteed is never really guaranteed. The
    value that you don't think you need to check is the one that
    someday will be passed. So, to protect yourself from the
    unknown, always have a default step in a switch statement.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
switch( hash_string( cmd ) )
{
   case hash_actions_file :
      ... code ...
      break;

   case hash_confdir :
      ... code ...
      break;

   default :
      log_error( ... );
      ... anomaly code goes here ...
      continue; / break; / exit( 1 ); / etc ...

} /* end switch( hash_string( cmd ) ) */</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you already have a default condition, you
    are obviously exempt from this point. Of note, most of the
    WIN32 code calls `DefWindowProc' after the switch statement.
    This API call *should* be included in a default statement.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Another Note:</emphasis> This is not so much a readability issue
    as a robust programming issue. The "anomaly code goes here" may
    be no more than a print to the STDERR stream (as in
    load_config). Or it may really be an ABEND condition.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> Programmer discretion is advised.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s38"><title>Try to avoid falling through cases in a
    switch statement.</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>In general, you will want to have a 'break' statement within
    each 'case' of a switch statement. This allows for the code to
    be more readable and understandable, and furthermore can
    prevent unwanted surprises if someone else later gets creative
    and moves the code around.</para>

    <para>The language allows you to plan the fall through from one
    case statement to another simply by omitting the break
    statement within the case statement. This feature does have
    benefits, but should only be used in rare cases. In general,
    use a break statement for each case statement.</para>

    <para>If you choose to allow fall through, you should comment both
    the fact of the fall through and reason why you felt it was
    necessary.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s39"><title>Use 'long' or 'short' Instead of
    'int'</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>On 32-bit platforms, int usually has the range of long. On
    16-bit platforms, int has the range of short.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> open-to-debate. In the case of most FSF
    projects (including X/GNU-Emacs), there are typedefs to int4,
    int8, int16, (or equivalence ... I forget the exact typedefs
    now). Should we add these to IJB now that we have a "configure"
    script?</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s40"><title>Don't mix size_t and other types</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The type of size_t varies across platforms. Do not make
    assumptions about whether it is signed or unsigned, or about
    how long it is. Do not compare a size_t against another
    variable of a different type (or even against a constant)
    without casting one of the values. Try to avoid using size_t if
    you can.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s41"><title>Declare each variable and struct on its
    own line.</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It can be tempting to declare a series of variables all on
    one line. Don't.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
long a = 0;
long b = 0;
long c = 0;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>long a, b, c;</para>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis> - there is more room for comments on the
    individual variables - easier to add new variables without
    messing up the original ones - when searching on a variable to
    find its type, there is less clutter to "visually"
    eliminate</para>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis> when you want to declare a bunch of loop
    variables or other trivial variables; feel free to declare them
    on 1 line. You should, although, provide a good comment on
    their functions.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s42"><title>Use malloc/zalloc sparingly</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Create a local struct (on the stack) if the variable will
    live and die within the context of one function call.</para>

    <para>Only "malloc" a struct (on the heap) if the variable's life
    will extend beyond the context of one function call.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
If a function creates a struct and stores a pointer to it in a
list, then it should definitely be allocated via `malloc'.
</programlisting>
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s43"><title>The Programmer Who Uses 'malloc' is
    Responsible for Ensuring 'free'</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you have to "malloc" an instance, you are responsible for
    insuring that the instance is `free'd, even if the deallocation
    event falls within some other programmer's code. You are also
    responsible for ensuring that deletion is timely (i.e. not too
    soon, not too late). This is known as "low-coupling" and is a
    "good thing (tm)". You may need to offer a
    free/unload/destructor type function to accommodate this.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
int load_re_filterfile( struct client_state *csp ) { ... }
static void unload_re_filterfile( void *f ) { ... }</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The developer cannot be expected to provide `free'ing
    functions for C run-time library functions ... such as
    `strdup'.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion. The "main" use of this
    standard is for allocating and freeing data structures (complex
    or nested).</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s44"><title>Add loaders to the `file_list' structure
    and in order</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>I have ordered all of the "blocker" file code to be in alpha
    order. It is easier to add/read new blockers when you expect a
    certain order.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> It may appear that the alpha order is broken in
    places by POPUP tests coming before PCRS tests. But since
    POPUPs can also be referred to as KILLPOPUPs, it is clear that
    it should come first.</para>

    
  </sect3>
    

    <sect3 id="s45"><title>"Uncertain" new code and/or changes to
    existing code, use FIXME</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you have enough confidence in new code or confidence in
    your changes, but are not *quite* sure of the repercussions,
    add this:</para>

    <para>/* FIXME: this code has a logic error on platform XYZ, *
    attempting to fix */ #ifdef PLATFORM ...changed code here...
    #endif</para>

    <para>or:</para>

    <para>/* FIXME: I think the original author really meant this...
    */ ...changed code here...</para>

    <para>or:</para>

    <para>/* FIXME: new code that *may* break something else... */
    ...new code here...</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you make it clear that this may or may not
    be a "good thing (tm)", it will be easier to identify and
    include in the project (or conversely exclude from the
    project).</para>

        that everything runs fine, and not to introduce problems in the
        very last minute.
    </para>
    <para>
        So when releasing a new version, please adhere exactly to the
        procedure outlined in this chapter.

    <sect2 id="versionnumbers">
    <title>Version numbers</title>

    <para>
      First you need to determine which version number the release will have. 
      <application>Privoxy</application> version numbers consist of three numbers,
      separated by dots, like in X.Y.Z, where:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              X, the version major, is rarely ever changed. It is increased by one if
              turning a development branch into stable substantially changes the functionality,
              user interface or configuration syntax. Majors 1 and 2 were 
              <application>Junkbuster</application>, and 3 will be the first stable
              <application>Privoxy</application> release.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Y, the version minor, represents the branch within the major version.
              At any point in time, there are two branches being maintained:
              The stable branch, with an even minor, say, 2N, in which no functionality is
              being added and only bug-fixes are made, and 2N+1, the development branch, in
              which the further development of <application>Privoxy</application> takes
              place.
              This enables us to turn the code upside down and inside out, while at the same time
              providing and maintaining a stable version.
              The minor is reset to zero (and one) when the major is incremented. When a development
              branch has matured to the point where it can be turned into stable, the old stable branch
              2N is given up (i.e. no longer maintained), the former development branch 2N+1 becomes the
              new stable branch 2N+2, and a new development branch 2N+3 is opened.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Z, the point or sub version, represents a release of the software within a branch.
              It is therefore incremented immediately before each code freeze. 
              In development branches, only the even point versions correspond to actual releases,
              while the odd ones denote the evolving state of the sources on CVS in between.
              It follows that Z is odd on CVS in development branches most of the time. There, it gets
              increased to an even number immediately before a code freeze, and is increased to an odd
              number again immediately thereafter.
              This ensures that builds from CVS snapshots are easily distinguished from released versions.
              The point version is reset to zero when the minor changes.

   <title>Uploading and Releasing Your Package</title>
    <para>
      After the package is ready, it is time to upload it 
      to SourceForge, and go through the release steps. The upload
      is done via FTP:
    </para>
     <para>
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          Upload to: <ulink url="ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/incoming">ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/incoming</ulink>
        </para>
      </listitem> 
      <listitem>
       <para>
         user: <literal>anonymous</literal>
       </para>
      </listitem> 
      <listitem>
       <para>
         password: <literal>ijbswa-developers@lists.sourceforge.net</literal>
       </para>
      </listitem> 
     </itemizedlist>
    </para> 
    <para>
     Or use the <command>make</command> targets as described above.
    </para>
    <para>
     Once this done go to <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=11118">http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=11118</ulink>, 
     making sure you are logged in. Find your target platform in the 
     second column, and click <literal>Add Release</literal>. You will 
     then need to create a new release for your package, using the format 
     of <literal>$VERSION ($CODE_STATUS)</literal>, e.g. <emphasis>&p-version;
     (beta)</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Now just follow the prompts. Be sure to add any appropriate Release
     notes. You should see your freshly uploaded packages in 
     <quote>Step 2. Add Files To This Release</quote>. Check the 
     appropriate box(es). Remember at each step to hit the 
     <quote>Refresh/Submit</quote> buttons! You should now see your 
     file(s) listed in Step 3. Fill out the forms with the appropriate 
     information for your platform, being sure to hit <quote>Update</quote>
     for each file. If anyone is monitoring your platform, check the 
     <quote>email</quote> box at the very bottom to notify them of 
     the new package. This should do it!
    </para>
    <para>
     If you have made errors, or need to make changes, you can go through 
     essentially the same steps, but select <literal>Edit Release</literal>, 
     instead of <literal>Add Release</literal>.

    When updating the webserver, please follow these steps to make
    sure that no broken links, inconsistent contents or permission
    problems will occur:
   </para>
   <para>
    If you have changed anything in the documentation source SGML files,
    do:

    <filename>doc/webserver/index.html</filename> automatically.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you changed the manual page source, generate
    <filename>doc/webserver/man-page/privoxy-man-page.html</filename>
    by running <quote><command>make man</command></quote>. (This is
    a separate target due to dependencies on some obscure perl scripts.

    create new directories under <filename>doc/webserver</filename>).
   </para>
   <para>
    Next, commit any changes from the above steps to CVS. All set? Then do
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>
  make webserver
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    This will do the upload to <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/">the
    webserver</ulink> (www.privoxy.org) and ensure all files and directories
    there are group writable.
   </para>
   <para>
